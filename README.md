![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/d-r-q/qbit.svg?branch=master)

**While early stages of development qbit code base has accumulated quite a few mistakes and design flaws, which blocking futher evolution. Currently I'm working on makeing qbit truly multiplafrom and pass all tests on native/linux and js/node platforms (see [Make qbit truly multi platform](https://github.com/d-r-q/qbit/projects/1)) for current status. The next goal is to [clean up](https://github.com/d-r-q/qbit/milestone/5) major design flaws**

## Vision
qbit is a research project aiming at creating distributed high available storage technology for Kotlin Multiplatform projects.

qbit will store an end user's data on his devices encrypted and use existing cloud storages as media to synchronize encrypted data and as additional backup device. Particular cloud storages would be easily replacable while life time of qbit-based system installation on end user's devices.

## Mission

Return the control of an end user's data back to end users. And put the fun back into persisting.
